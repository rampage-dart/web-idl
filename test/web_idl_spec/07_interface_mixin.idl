// Example 7
// The following IDL fragment defines an interface, Entry, and an interface
// mixin, Observable. The includes statement specifies that Observableâ€™s
// members are always included on objects implementing Entry.

interface Entry {
  readonly attribute unsigned short entryType;
  // ...
};

interface mixin Observable {
  undefined addEventListener(DOMString type,
                        EventListener listener,
                        boolean useCapture);
  // ...
};

Entry includes Observable;
